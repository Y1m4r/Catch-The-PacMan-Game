# ðŸŽ® Catch The Pac-Man (Go Version)
A simple 2D arcade game prototype implemented in Go, based on an original Java concept. The objective is to click ("catch") all the moving Pac-Mans before they bounce too many times off the walls or each other.

This project serves as an exercise in applying Go principles to game development, including concurrency, 2D graphics, and data persistence.
